"""The map's own sky layers as images, and composites with the map (from capture.py's sky/ shots).

Layers, written next to the map image:
  <id>-layer-fixed.png       the fixed skybox: it moves with the camera, so it is one screen-sized
                             backdrop for a viewer, not part of the map
  <id>-layer-background.png  the parallax model's background art, with transparency where it lets
                             the fixed skybox through
  <id>-layer-haze.png        the parallax model's haze, matted (colour and transparency)
  <id>-layer-map.png         the map (the same image as <id>.png)
  <id>-composite.png         background, haze and map together, transparent where none of them is
  <id>-composite-on-black.png  the haze and the map over black (no background art, no fixed skybox)
  <id>-composite-with-fixed.png  the same over the fixed skybox, stretched behind everything like a
                             backdrop (opaque, as the skybox is)
  <id>-layers.json           how a viewer places each layer: its rate (how fast it moves against
                             the map) and which of its pixels is behind which map cell
On a map of several arenas (Punisher Arena) the layers and <id>-layers.json, listing each
arena's image, but no composites.

Each sky shot is matted on its own (the haze from its shots over white and black, with the white
level the game's lighting gives the key taken from the white-without-haze shot; the background
art from its shots over black and over the fixed skybox), then the shots are blended into one
image per layer: the view of the layer from the middle camera position, as if the screen were
large enough to show all of it.

The shells aren't level: on Battlefield of Eternity they are a plane rising towards the north, so
the sky's shift between two camera positions changes across the screen (a whole-shot shift by
the measured rate left the towers doubled, up to 60 px apart). So the depth plane is fitted to
patches matched where neighbouring shots overlap (its tilt shared by the layers, as they are
shells of one model; each layer's depth at the middle its own, or from its measured rate when it
has too few matches), and each shot is warped into place through it. With the camera looking
straight down, a shot of a plane maps onto the middle camera's view by an affine transform.

The composites are at map scale, with each map point showing the sky the game draws behind it
when the camera is centred on it: the sky layers stretched by 1/rate about the middle camera
position.
