"""How fast the map's own sky layers move against the map, for a parallax viewer.

A sky model on the parallax layer is a set of shells far below the map: when the camera pans,
it moves across the screen slower than the map does. The rate (sky shift / map shift: 1 moves
with the map, 0 stays put) is what a viewer needs to move each layer with the view. Measured,
not configured: the camera is put at the middle of the map and at two offsets, and at each the
map is shot, then (near clip past the map, so only the sky is drawn, at speed 1, which freezes
it in the same position every time) each sky layer; phase correlation gives the shifts. The
fixed skybox moves with the camera (rate 0 by definition).

Layers: "parallax", the map's parallax model as it is (background art and haze together); and
"haze", the keyed copy over black, when the map has one (sky.mjs PARALLAX_KEYS), which shows the
haze shells alone. Written to <id>/sky-layers.json.
