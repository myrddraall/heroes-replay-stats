"""Stitch captured screenshots into one top-down image of the battleground.

    python stitch.py work/towers-of-doom-structures.json [--tiles]

Each screenshot is anchored where the map script reported its camera (positions.json, written
by capture.py), and every screenshot is also matched against its right and lower neighbours,
like panorama software, to measure their real offsets; the scale (pixels per map cell) comes
from those matches, and all positions are solved together (least squares, with matches that
disagree dropped). Black and featureless screenshots are skipped. Neighbours meet along a seam
routed through their overlap where they agree best, near the halfway line, blended over a few
pixels. Without positions.json, the screenshots are placed by the matches alone and the
map-to-pixel conversion is fitted from the middle of the map outward.

Writes, next to the tiles folder:
  <id>.png          the full image, with transparency where the map lets the void through
                    (matted from each tile's shots over a white and a black skybox, or the
                    black-painted void made transparent)
  <id>-preview.jpg  a 2048 px wide preview (over dark grey)
  <id>-on-white.jpg the full image flattened over white (easier to look at than the alpha)
  <id>.geo.json     scale and origin, to convert map cells to image pixels (for replay overlays)
                    (a map of several arenas, e.g. Punisher Arena: <id>-<area>.png etc., one per arena)
  <id>-tiles/       with --tiles: a Google Maps style pyramid ({z}/{y}/{x}.png, 256 px)
